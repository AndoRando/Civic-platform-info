### CIVIC Platform Backend Information 


#### Major backend tools

* Python, Django, and Django REST Framework to provide a web-browsable API and serialization of data for the Front-End

* PostgreSQL for data storage

*thanks Troy and Jay*


For API design and documentation, most teams have been using [Swagger](http://swagger.io/)

See also [DevOps documentation](https://github.com/hackoregon/Civic-platform-info/blob/master/devOps-info.md) for the backend service pattern, endpoint catalog, and deployment methods.
